# Eye-commands

## Can we build a user interface for individuals with severely-limited mobility using only an ordinary camera and machine learning?

### This is a project started by Lucas Henrique, Daniel Kashkett, and Giovanbattista Amato for a UK based non-profit called AceCentre. AceCentre works with individuals with difficulties to communicate. The Eye-Commander is designed as an open-source solution to eye-tracking that will work without the need for a fancy camera or expensive software.
